# r_snippets

The file `preload.R` contains some useful R snippets that [I](https://max.pm) have developed over time. This set of snippets makes serious use of R almost possible. This set of snippets is bound to be enhanced and amended over time. Feel free to just copy that file into your own R project. You can load it like this:

```r
source("preload.R")
```

## Dependencies

If you use all the functions in `preload.R`, you need these R packages:

1. texreg, preferably as found [here](https://github.com/mrpg/texreg_fork)ยน
2. lmtest
3. sandwich

ยน You can use `install.packages("remotes"); remotes::install_github("mrpg/texreg_fork")` to install that.

When using `tt()`, include these LaTeX packages:

```tex
